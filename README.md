# Lariat-Rental-Car-2019-Strategies

In this project I was tasked with analyzing transaction data from "Lariat Rental Car" and comming to conclusions on how they can better their busienss. I chose to do this by creating a baseline of their previous year strategies and comparing that to hypothetical modifications to their fleet as well as recomendations for their targeted advertisting.

The excel model was made so that they can use to make data-informed decisions about their fleet. It incldes a dashboard to analyze the performance metrics of each vehicle in the fleet vs the company averages.

The PowerPoint deck provides an analysis of the problem and two recommendations.
